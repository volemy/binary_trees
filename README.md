#  PROJECT: Binary trees
## Overview
A Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is essential to distinguish this from a B-tree, which is a balanced tree data structure commonly used in databases and filesystems.
## Data Structure and Algorithms - Tree
Trees in data structures represent a hierarchical relationship between elements. They are used to represent various data structures like binary trees, heaps, and more. Algorithms related to trees focus on operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
## Key Concepts
### Tree Traversal
Tree traversal refers to the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure systematically. There are mainly three types of tree traversals:

Inorder Traversal: Visit left subtree, then root, and finally right subtree.
Preorder Traversal: Visit root, then left subtree, and finally right subtree.
Postorder Traversal: Visit left subtree, then right subtree, and finally root.
###Binary Search Tree (BST)
A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree with the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
The left and right subtree must also be a binary search tree.
BSTs provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
### Data Structures: Binary Tree
inary Trees are foundational data structures that allow for efficient data storage and retrieval. They are prevalent in computer science and are the basis for more complex data structures like AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and more.
